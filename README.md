# Energy states and wavefunctions solver for an electron in a quantum well
The solver searches for solutions of 1-D Schr√∂dinger equation.
The calculation is based on [*finite difference method*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method).


# Binder stopped working
The demo can no longer start (found in September 2024). Will look for another tool to serve and update the code accordingly.


# Interactive Demo
Click the binder badge below to launch an interactive demo notebook. A user can provide information of a quantum well and solve for available energy states and wavefunctions.
